Your registered email address linked to Surfshark

The password you created during sign-up

Access to the device where you want to use Surfshark VPN

Reliable internet connection to reach Surfshark’s servers

If you already have these handy, you’re ready to proceed.

Download and Install the Surfshark VPN Application

Once the app is ready, follow these steps to log in:

Open the Surfshark VPN Application
Launch the app from your desktop, mobile home screen, or app drawer.

Locate the Sign-In Screen
Upon launch, you should see the login screen requesting your email and password. If you previously logged in and enabled automatic login, you may skip this step.

Enter Your Credentials
Type your registered email address and password carefully. Avoid typos, and check if caps lock is off, since passwords are case sensitive.

Use Autofill if Available
For ease, consider using a password manager that securely stores and autofills credentials. This minimizes errors and speeds the process.

Click or Tap the Sign-In Button
Once your credentials are filled, click “Sign In” or the equivalent button on your device.

Wait for Authentication
